# ansible_task_for_docker_configuration

### Write an Ansible PlayBook that does the following operations in the managed nodes -

ðŸ”¹ Configure Docker package

ðŸ”¹ Start and enable Docker services

ðŸ”¹ Pull the httpd server image from the Docker Hub

ðŸ”¹ Run the httpd container and expose it to the public

ðŸ”¹ Copy the HTML code in /var/www/html directory and start the webserver

**prerequisites -**

1. Configure Ansible on the controller node.

2. Controller Node and managed nodes should have network connectivity.

### So, let's get started

Configure Controller node inventory file. Add all the hosts `managed nodes` in it.

```
[docker]
192.168.43.39   ansible_ssh_user=root  ansible_ssh_pass="<password of node>"
```

here, I am adding only one node. but we can add as many as we want to configure a web server

> Ansible Playbook

Write Ansible Playbook for configuring docker for Apache Web server.

so, create a workspace in the controller node. start writing ansible-playbook and extension should be `.yml` or `.yaml` of the file because we write playbook in *YAML language*.

```
- name: "Configure Docker"
  hosts: docker
  gather_facts: yes
  vars:
    - image: "httpd"
    - webpages: "index.html"
    - webpath: "/root/web/"
  tasks:
    - name: "Check Docker package Installed or Not"
        shell: "rpm -q docker-ce"
        register: checkd
        ignore_errors: yes

    - name: "Debug check docker package"
      debug:
        var: checkd
```

here, I added my hosts (managed nodes) as â€˜dockerâ€™ as I write in the inventory file. and created some variables which we gonna use later in the playbook.

First I have checked whether the docker package is already installed or not on the managed node. If the â€˜dockerâ€™ package is not installed then it will give us an error and that error we can use further as a condition in the playbook which we will see ahead in the playbook.

> Configure yum repository and Install docker-ce package

If the above code gives an error then this code will run and configure the yum repository to Install the `docker-ce` package. And if the docker-ce package is already installed on the managed node then these both steps will be skipped.

```
- name: "configure yum for docker-ce"
  yum_repository:
      name: Docker
      description: Repository for Installing Docker-ce package
      file: docker
      baseurl: https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/
      gpgcheck: no
  when: ( checkd.failed == true or checkd.rc != 0 )
  register: yum
  ignore_errors: yes

- name: "Debug yum configuration"
  debug:
    var: yum

- name: "Install docker-ce package"
  shell: "{{ ansible_pkg_mgr }} install docker-ce --nobest -y"
  when: ( checkd.rc != 0 or checkd.failed == true ) and ( yum.state == "present" )
  register: installdocker

- name: "Debug Install Docker"
  debug:
    var: installdocker
```

Here, I have used the `shell` module of ansible because the `yum` or `dnf` module does not have any `nobest` option, *This is one of the limitations of Ansible*.

> Installation of `docker-ce` package depends on two conditions -

1. when there is no `docker-ce` package is already installed on the managed node.

2. And when the `yum` repository is created successfully.

> Start and enable Docker services

```
- name: "start Docker services"
  service:
      name: docker
      state: started
      enabled: yes
  register: srvc

- name: "Debug Docker Service"
  debug:
    var: srvc.changed
```

From this block of code, the docker service will start and enable on the managed nodes.

> Install `docker` python library

For pulling any docker image from hub.docker.com or doing anything on the docker container we need the `docker` or `docker-py` *library* on the managed node. *otherwise, any of docker-related ansible modules will not work on the managed node*.

```
- name: "Check Docker python Library is Installed or Not"
  shell: "pip3 list | grep docker"
  register: dockerLibrary
  ignore_errors: yes

- name: "Debug docker Library"
  debug:
      var: dockerLibrary

- name: "Install python36 package"
  package:
      name: python36
      state: present
  register: ipython
  when: dockerLibrary.rc != 0 or dockerLibrary.failed == true

- name: "Debug python36 package"
  debug:
    var: ipython

- name: "Install docker library"
  pip:
      name: "docker"
  when: ( dockerLibrary.rc != 0 or dockerLibrary.failed == true ) and ipython.rc == 0
```

Like before I checked the docker package, and if it is not installed then I write yum module and package module, likewise here also first I checked for the `docker` *python library*, and if it is not installed then first it installs `python36` package and then it will install `docker` library.

> Pull `httpd` Docker Image

```
- name: "Pull Docker Images"
  docker_image:
      name: "{{ image }}"
      source: pull
```

the variable we created at the top of the playbook â€˜imageâ€™ we have used here. and this code will pull `httpd` image from  [Docker HTTPD Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd) . this is why all our managed nodes should have Internet connectivity.

> Copy Web Pages

create a new file in your workspace. name it anything and give extension `.html`. I named my file `index.html`

```
<h1>Welcome!!! to my Web Server</h1>

<h2>Hello This is Shashi Kant</h2>

<h3>This is Docker Container from Ansible</h3>
```

I write these three lines for testing.

```
- name: "Create Directory to copy web pages"
  file:
    path: "{{ webpath }}"
    state: directory
  register: mkdir

- name: "Debug create Directory"
  debug:
    var: mkdir

- name: "Copy Web Pages"
  template:
      src: "{{ webpages }}"
      dest: "{{ webpath }}"
  register: copywebpages

- name: "Debug Copy web pages"
  debug:
    var: copywebpages
```

Now add this code in the playbook for copying web pages.

and finally, launch Docker Container.

> Launch Docker Container

Now finally write code for launching the docker container. and expose it to the public world. as they also can access your website.

```
- name: "Launch Docker Container"
  docker_container:
      name: ansibleWebContainer
      image: "{{ image }}"
      state: started
      exposed_ports: "80"
      ports: "8080:80"
      volumes: "{{ webpath }}:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/"
      network_mode: bridge
      restart: yes
      restart_policy: always
  when: mkdir.failed == false and copywebpages.failed == false
```

using the docker_container module we can launch the docker container. here I used `httpd` Images. and expose it to the public world on `port no.` 8080. and it is using `volume` of the managed node where we have copied our web pages.

Used `bridge` type network as `network_mode` in the container, it will provide network connectivity in a docker container.

I used `restart` and `restart_policy` here because it will give me some little management of the container. like if my container goes down due to some reason then docker will automatically launch the same new container for me, with same web pages. until I manually delete or stop this container.

and this play runs only when our above code of copying web pages and creating directory will run successfully.

Now, Finally, Run Ansible Playbook.

```
ansible-playbook <name_of_ansible_playbook.yml>
```
